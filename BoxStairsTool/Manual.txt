BoxStairs Tool Manual

1. Click the GameObject/3D Object > BoxStairs button on the menu, or in the hierarchy's context menu, to create a default GameObject called BoxStairs on the (0,0,0) position. If a GameObject is selected on the Hierarchy, the new GameObject will be created as a child and on the local position (0,0,0). The same applies to several GameObjects selected, each of them will have a child BoxStairs GameObject.

2. With the object selected, choose where do you want to be placed the pivot of the object. In order to see the selected handle correctly (Downstairs or Upstairs), you must select pivot option on the editor Gizmo Display Toggles.

3. Edit the Stairs Width, Height and Depth parameters to set the volume which will contain the stairs (this is represented with a green box when you select the GameObject), the Steps Number parameter (clicking over +1,+10,-1,-10 buttons) to set how many steps will have the stairs and check Three Sides parameter if you want stairs on three sides (Note that this option will fix the relation between Width and Depth, first one will be double of the second one). Finally, assign a material to the Stairs Material slot. Play with the parameters until you get the desired design. If you want to finalize the object's edition ability, click the finalize button and it will remain on the hierarchy as a group of boxes under a empty root.

This tool doesn't accept multi object editing.

Advanced Usage

This tool introduces on the 1.4.0 version advanced features to allow more customization of the object.

Steps Height and Depth

You can set the Height/Depth of each step individually setting its property on the specific input field, the element 0 is the bottom most step. The steps will "push" the others to match the space you introduce.

The last step will have its dimension supedited to the space remaining between the sum of the previous steps and the Stairs Height/Depth, unless the Stairs Height/Depth Drived By Steps is on, in that case, you will be able to edit all the steps and you will not be able to edit the Stairs Height/Depth property which will be modified by the sum of the steps.

Each action which modifies the Stairs Height/Depth property will redistribute the space on that dimension among all the steps, to prevent this and to conserve your custom values you must enable the Keep Custom Height/Depth Values option.

Materials

When assigning a material to the Stairs Material slot, all steps will take this one, but if you want an specific material for some specific steps you only need to drag the desired material onto the specific step material slot.
