# Setup
Download the latest version of **BoxStairs Tool** from the [releases page](https://github.com/JAFS6/BoxStairsTool/releases), unzip it and **put** the **BoxStairsTool folder on** your Unity3D **project's assets folder**. This creates a new menu on your Unity Editor called BoxStairs Tool.

# Usage
Click the **BoxStairs Tool menu > Create BoxStairs** button to create a default GameObject called BoxStairs on the (0,0,0) position.

With the object selected, **choose** where do you want to be placed the **pivot** of the object, **edit** the Stairs **Width**, **Height** and **Depth** parameters to set the volume which will contain the stairs, and the **Steps Number** parameter to set how many steps will have the stairs. Finally, **assign** a material to the Stairs **Material** slot. Play with the parameters until you get the desired design. If you want to **finalize the object**'s edition ability, click the finalize button and it will remain on the hierarchy as a group of boxes under a empty root.
